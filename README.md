# Topcoder Platform Interface Definitions

A collection of interface definitions for the Topcoder Platform. These are used to define the API for the Topcoder Platform, and are used to generate the API documentation, stubs for the API clients, and the API server.

## Roadmap

- Automate building stubs and documentation and creating PRs for the API clients and server for existing projects, and new repos for new projects.
- Automate provisioning database tables and indexes using the domain definitions

## Note

This is a work in progress. The definitions are not yet complete, and the build process is not yet automated. Expect rapid changes to the definitions!
